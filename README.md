# Head Start CSS Animations with React

Presentation for the [React Animations](https://open-sessions.thinkful.com/workshops/head-start-css-animations-with-react-1115/) workshop at Thinkful.

## Getting started

You're welcome to code along. This entire presentation is actually a huge React component. :sunglasses:
You can hack it as you wish!

First, install dependencies using `npm`:

```
$ npm install
```

Then, use the `hot` script to start in hot reloading mode.

```
$ npm run hot
```

Finally, open http://localhost:3000 and you should see the presentation.

The main code for the presentation is in the file `presentation/deck.jsx`.

## Development

This presentation uses the awesome
[Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) framework.
